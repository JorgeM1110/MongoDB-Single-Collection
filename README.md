# MongoDB-Single-Collection

This project focuses on introducing MongoDB, specifically with a single collection

Objective:

The primary goal is to familiarize with MongoDB and the Object Document Mapper (ODM) concept by implementing basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a single collection.

Procedure:

- Creating a departments collection: defining the structure of the departments collection, including attributes and uniqueness constraints.

- Moon Modeler: Introduction to Moon Modeler for visually representing the database schema, aiding in conceptualization and planning.

- Console-based menu application: develop a simple menu-driven application in Python, allowing users to interact with the MongoDB database by creating, listing, and deleting department records.

Key Components:

- Data Model: Understanding MongoDB's document-oriented structure and the concept of collections.

- Uniqueness Constraints: Introduction to enforcing constraints within MongoDB collections, albeit through code.

- Moon Modeler: Utilizing tools for visual database modeling to enhance understanding and planning.

- Console Application: Implementing a basic user interface for CRUD operations, demonstrating practical application of MongoDB interactions.

Tools Required:

Setting up a MongoDB cluster in the cloud, utilizing Moon Modeler for schema visualization, and employing PyCharm with the pymongo library for Python-MongoDB connectivity

This project provides hands-on experience in MongoDB, laying the groundwork for more complex database-driven applications in the future. It emphasizes the importance of understanding database fundamentals and effective collaboration in software development.
